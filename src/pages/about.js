        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>
          I made my way into the software engineering field in a rather
          roundabout way.
          <br />
          <br />
          After getting my BA in International Affairs and Anthropology, I spent
          time working in higher ed, social impact, and startups. I later got my
          MBA at the Universidad de Palermo in Buenos Aires, Argentina, then
          spent two years as the General Manager of a coworking space for tech
          companies in Miami.
        </p>
        <h3>So what got me into tech?</h3>
        <p>
          Frankly, I no longer had a clear idea of what I wanted to do with my
          life, and was flailing for answers when I came across an affordable
          full stack web development course at a local community college.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>
            I had zero background in programming, and no idea if I would even
            like it.
          </strong>{" "}
          But everyone is always saying we should all learn to code, and I had a
          sneaking suspicion that this was one of those things life puts in
          front of you, where you just have to say "F it" and go for it.
          <br />
          <br />
          So that's what I did.
          <br />
          <br />
          Lucky for me, I immediately enjoyed the work, even before I understood
          much of what I was doing —{" "}
          <strong>the creativity, the problem solving, the logic</strong>. I
          could tell that it was scratching a certain itch in my brain that
          hadn't been fulfilled in any of my other jobs.
          <br />
          <br />
          Long story short, I decided to stick with it. I finished the course,
          and spent the next seven months studying intensively and applying for
          jobs.
          <br />
          <br />
          The job search is a topic worthy of an entire blog post (and it will
          be, soon), but the happy ending is that{" "}
          <strong>
            I managed to land a wonderful job as a software developer!
          </strong>
          <br />
          <br />I now work at{" "}
          <a href="https://www.watscoventures.com/">Watsco Ventures</a>,
          building internal tooling and automation for the{" "}
          <a href="https://www.oncallair.com/">OnCall Air</a> team, using mostly
          Ruby and SQL (and soon Python).
          <br />
          <br />
          <h3>Enough work talk. Other fun facts about me:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              I grew up in New England, but now am an enthusiastic Miamian. No
              more New England winters for me, no ma'am.
            </li>
            <li>
              I really, really like climbing stuff. That's why I do pole dance.
              It's sort of like doing gymnastics and ballet at the same time
              while climbing a tree. My idea of a good time! (Also it got me
              absolutely ripped).
            </li>
            <li>
              I'm a big fan of riding my bike anywhere I can — for fun, for
              fitness, for transportation, for the grocery store.
            </li>
            <li>
              I care a lot about the environment and do everything I can in my
              daily life to reduce my impact: composting food scraps; eating
              heavily plant-based (I still eat some seafood, but frequently eat
              vegan, and consume only small quantities of occasional
              cheese/egg);and doing my best to reduce plastic consumption by
              buying consciously and carrying supplies with me like a water
              bottle, grocery bag, and my infamous spork (it's a knife, spoon,
              and fork all in one — and a great conversation starter).
            </li>
            <li>
              I like to express love/generosity through handmade gifts rather
              than buying stuff people don't need. Frequent fliers: handmade
              birthday/holiday cards and homecooked meals.
