When I first moved to South Florida I didn't _get_ the Everglades.

I was used to the forests, hills, and mountains of the Northeast. Places where you can, generally, tromp around as you please, on or off hiking trails. That is to say, it is physically possible to do so, because the ground is mostly...well, solid ground. Creature-wise, just learn "red next to black, you're okay jack; red next to yellow, you're a dead fellow", and that black bears are more scared of you than you are of them, and you are pretty much good to go.

The Everglades, on the other hand, are mostly water. Tromping on foot is limited at best. And there are alligators? Pythons? Unknown insect/arachnid horrors? Yikes.

I drove a couple of times along US 41. From the car I saw gators sunning themselves along the canal. Beyond that, impenetrable, swampy no-man's land. No meandering hikes to be found here.

I went to a couple of visitors' centers. Half-mile-long boardwalks with hoards of tourists. This wasn't hiking either. I didn't return to the Everglades for a long time.

How to engage with this swampy, prickly expanse?

But then I started to learn more: the perfect balance of its ecosystems â€” a more impressive feat of evolutionary engineering than we could ever dream of implementing. The flow of water. The change of the tides. How the ever-present canals we are so accustomed to in South Florida were actually built to drain the Everglades of its life force, for the sake of development.

Yet one third of Floridians get their drinking water from the Everglades.

We debate endlessly over seawalls and raising roads, yet our best defender against flooding waits patiently, stoically for our attention.

I began to realize there was more to the Everglades than I thought.

I began learning that all birds have beaks perfectly designed for their respective tasks. The large wading birds' straight, sharp beak: impaling. The dopey white ibises' long, curved beak: poking and digging in the mud. Roseate spoonbills: sweeping up small fish and crustaceans as if with, well, a spoon.

I watched as the emblematic anhingas dove into and burst forth from the water to flip their prey into their gullet in one gulp, and then held their wings out to dry their fluffy plumage in the sun like majestic statues.

I learned that bald cypress islands are a critical support ecosystem, and that the taller the cypress, the deeper the water.

I learned to distinguish between a black-capped night heron, a green heron, a tricolored heron, the grandfatherly wood stork, black vultures versus turkey vultures, and yellow-bellied sliders vs Florida softshell turtles. I learned that male anhingas are all black, while females have a light brown head and neck.

I learned that vultures make little grunting noises like a whiny dog when they are eating with their flock (known as a kettle, when feeding).

I learned that pelicans turn their head slightly to the left when dive-bombing the water, to protect their esophagus and trachea which are located to the right.

I learned that in the space of a few hundred feet, you might discover any number of diverse ecosystems that look perplexingly different next to each other, yet all run on water: marl prarires, peatland, hammocks, mangroves, pinelands, freshwater sloughs.

I learned that the Everglades is more than visitors' centers. Backcountry trailheads, dirt roads, campgrounds, state parks, preserves, canals. I learned that you can, indeed, get out of your car, and, as they say, "get amongst it".

I would never have told you we shouldn't protect the Everglades, but now I think about the fresh black bear tracks I saw in the mud. I think about the sound of rough sawgrass swaying in the wind; the pink flash of a roseate spoonbill flying overhead; the cacophony of a mangrove at dawn; the hot, wet, fertile air of the swamp marsh, that feels like breathing in life itself.

Y'all, I'm no park ranger or biology major. Everything I have learned has been through curiosity, Google, and bird ID apps. I've just always liked to know how things work. Know their names. I think it makes me feel like we are part of each other, like I am a part of something bigger.

I want you to know that I'm not special or somehow predisposed to having this knowledge: I didn't grow up around the Everglades; I drive a sensible four-door sedan, not a pickup truck, if that's your concern; I don't own a kayak, or hiking boots, or a bike rack (though I'm considering changing that).

What's my point? I guess I just want to tell you that the Everglades can be yours too, if you'd like.
