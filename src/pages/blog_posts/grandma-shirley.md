This Mother’s Day got me thinking a lot — about my own mom, who I love, appreciate, and admire dearly and deeply — and also about my paternal grandmother. Ever since the day in 2014 when we found a photo of her in her early 20s, in which she looked like my twin sister, I began to feel a certain kinship with her.

She went to Barnard College in the 1930s, graduating at just 20 years old. You had to be smart as a whip to do that back then — even moreso as a woman! Later, she pursued her Master’s in Education, as if a Bachelor's in the 1930s wasn’t badass enough.

This weekend I was suddenly struck with inspiration: I wonder what information might be available online from her academic life?

I wasn’t disappointed.

It turns out Barnard has a spectacular digital archive and I was able to find her featured in the 1938 yearbook ("mortarboard”) as the secretary of the psychology club.

I was fascinated to discover this, but the biggest shock was to see MY OWN ACTUAL FACE in the yearbook photo.

I can’t really describe the feeling — it’s like seeing yourself go back in time. Like a movie where the main character finds a time machine or a magic necklace.

I also found the abstract from her Master’s thesis in 1969, which advocated for sexual education in elementary schools! Another 🤯 moment.

I’m sharing this because it’s generally amazing, and, perhaps most importantly, because it reminds me that mothers (and parents in general) are people too, with their own inner lives and dreams and fears and goals.

All of this makes me feel a deep sense of loss for never asking my grandma more about all of this (she passed away when I was 16 and a rather clueless teenager). What was it like to go to college as a woman then? What was it like to live through WWII? I have a lot of questions I’ll never be able to ask.

It also makes me think about how she was a brilliant, educated woman who held a variety of jobs during her life and was involved in her community (she was a longtime member of the League of Women Voters!), yet at the same time, being a housewife was one of the central threads of her life story. I wonder — often — if there were any aspects of her life in which she felt she didn’t get to fulfill her potential or her dreams.

I look at myself now — having had more opportunities than most to study, travel, make my own choices, and generally be free and safe; and most recently, having had the opportunity to transition into software engineering, a field whose timely equivalent would have been mostly off-limits to my grandmother — and I hope that she is somehow living through me.

I don’t believe in heaven or the afterlife and all the jazz, but my grandmother and I have the same face, and I can only hope that in some way she is with me on my journey, and that maybe I am bringing some of her unfulfilled dreams to life.

But the best way I can think of to honor her gifts — her willing and unwilling sacrifices — is to pass them on to others. I hope to not only open the door of the STEM field to people who might not have had the opportunity otherwise — people who, like me, never envisioned themselves being capable — but also to make it more inviting and supportive once they walk through the door.
